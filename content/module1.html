Probability, Percent, Rational Number Equivalence</h1></div><div class="" data-unknown="true">Seventh grade begins with problem solving as students review and apply arithmetic with whole numbers as they investigate chance processes. Probability provides students with opportunities to build fluency with fractions, percents, and decimals from previous grades - and recognize equivalent forms of rational numbers. Number line models are appropriate. In addition to covering basic counting techniques and listing outcomes in a sample space, students distinguish theoretical probabilities from experimental (frequentist) approaches to estimate probabilities. This chapter concludes with a section specifically about solving percent problems, including those involving discounts, interest, taxes, tips, and percent increase or decrease.</div>
